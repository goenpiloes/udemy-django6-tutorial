# README

This repo was made by following udemy tutorial made by DennisIvy [Django Python: Build a Full Stack Website with Features](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-2021-complete-course/). You may check its github [repo](https://github.com/divanov11/Django-Course). However, the repo still uses Django 5. Thus, this repo tries to rewrite the app to Django 6.

Requirements
```
python==3.12
django==6.0
```

If you find any error, feel free to raise an issue to let me know. Thank you, and happy coding!
